and/or its components (hardware and software) which is distributed
under such, including copyright, design, and patent.

All licensors‘s copyrights, designs, and patents as far as relevant to

right, the right-to-repair, by giving users complete freedom of use,
copy, modification, and hack, while promoting a fair competition by
securing intellectual property rights to prevent vendor locking and
patent trolling.

license incompatible with OCL remains unaffected by OCL.

allowing other community members to do everything that YOU MAY. This

from the product and/or its components.
